80. Start with a base class Libraryltem that includes common
attributes like itemID, title, and author, and methods like
checkout() and returnltem(). Create subclasses such as Book,
Magazine, and DVD, each inheriting from Libraryltem. Add unique
attributes to each subclass, like ISBN for Book, issueNumber for
Magazine, and duration for DVD.

81. Create a class Person with attributes name and age. Override
equals() to compare Person objects based on their attributes.
Override hashCode() consistent with the definition of equals().

82. Create a class ArrayOperations with a static nested class Statistics.
Statistics could have methods like mean(), median(), which
operate on an array.
