=======================CHALLENGE  Based on  Abstraction ================

83. Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method
calculateArea(). Implement two subclasses: Circle and
Square. Each subclass should have relevant attributes (like
radius for Circle, side for Square) and their own
implementation of the calculateArea() method.

84. Create an interface Flyable with an abstract method fly().
Create an abstract class Bird that implements Flyable.
Implement a subclass Eagle that extends Bird. Provide an
implementation for the fly() method.
